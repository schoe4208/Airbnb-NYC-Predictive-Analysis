## Project Overview
In the vibrant landscape of New York City, where towering skyscrapers adorn the skyline and a dynamic tapestry of cultures converges, one aspect remains consistent: the steep cost of accommodations. With the Big Apple consistently topping the charts for the most expensive lodging in the country, finding affordable yet comfortable options can be a daunting task for both tourists and residents alike.

As highlighted by industry reports, New York City boasts not only high average room rates but also a limited availability of affordable options, particularly in prime locations like Manhattan. This disparity between demand and supply leaves many travelers grappling with exorbitant prices, often compromising their budgets or settling for less desirable accommodations.

Amidst this backdrop, the emergence of platforms like Airbnb has offered a glimmer of hope, presenting travelers with a plethora of alternative lodging options beyond traditional hotels. However, navigating the vast landscape of Airbnb listings in NYC can be overwhelming, with thousands of properties vying for attention, each with its own set of amenities, locations, and price points.

With access to an Airbnb dataset comprised of almost 100,000 entries, this project aims to uncover the best Airbnb deals in New York City.

## Business Problem 
Navigating the bustling streets and vibrant neighborhoods of New York City can be both exhilarating and overwhelming for tourists. The city's sheer size and complexity, coupled with its frenetic pace and diverse cultural landscape, present numerous challenges for visitors seeking to make the most of their experience. Finding the right accomodations does not have to be one of those challenges, with Airbnb offering great deals for the budget conscious tourists. This project aims to understand the attributes of Airbnb listings that contribute to better deals.

## Data Understanding
For the project, following dataset was utilized for the analysis:

Airbnb Dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramvir705/airbnb-data)
This dataset with 67,122 entries offers a detailed overview of Airbnb listings across the major cities in the U.S. (NYC, LA, SF, DC, Chicago, Boston), providing information on property features, pricing, reviews, and host characteristics. To conduct the comprehensive analysis, we have focused on only NYC Airbnb listings.
